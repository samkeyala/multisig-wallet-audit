# 🔍 Smart Contract Security Audit Report

**Contract Name**: MultiSigWallet  
**Author**: Samuel Mwanza 
**Audit Date**: July 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Severity Levels**:  
- ✅ Info – Minor recommendation  
- ⚠️ Low – Low impact or edge case  
- ❗ Medium – Functional flaws or common exploits  
- 🔥 High – Severe risk, needs immediate fix  

---

## 🧾 Summary

The `MultiSigWallet` contract implements a basic multi-signature wallet requiring multiple confirmations from predefined owners before executing transactions. It uses mapping-based logic to prevent duplicate confirmations and protect against unauthorized access.

---

## 🔐 Security Findings

### ✅ 1. Access Control – **[PASS]**
- Only listed owners can submit, confirm, revoke, and execute transactions.
- `onlyOwner` modifier is implemented properly.

### ❗ 2. External Call Safety – **[MEDIUM]**
- `executeTransaction()` uses `.call()` to external addresses.
- Safe due to being placed last in logic (checks → effects → interactions).
- **Recommendation**: Explicitly label this pattern in code comments to help future audits.

### ⚠️ 3. Denial of Service by Owner Spamming – **[LOW]**
- Large number of submitted transactions can increase storage and gas cost.
- No limit on active transactions.
- **Mitigation**: Implement a cap on pending transactions or archiving.

### ⚠️ 4. Gas Optimization
- Caching `owners.length` inside loops can save gas.
- Consider using `immutable` for `required` if not meant to change.

### ✅ 5. Event Logging – **[PASS]**
- All state-changing actions emit events.
- This improves traceability and monitoring.

## 🧪 Static Analysis Results

### 🔹 Slither Results

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Info | Function `getTransaction()` returns a struct tuple; may consume gas in read-heavy usage |
| Info | Owner array checked manually for uniqueness – acceptable |
| ✅ | No reentrancy detected |
| ✅ | No delegatecall / low-level call misuse |

### 🔹 Mythril Results

- No integer overflow/underflow
- No reentrancy
- No uninitialized storage
- No tx.origin usage

## 🛡️ Final Verdict

| Category             | Status     |
|----------------------|------------|
| Access Control       | ✅ Secure  |
| Replay Protection    | ✅ Secure  |
| Logic Validity       | ✅ Pass    |
| Reentrancy           | ✅ Safe    |
| Timestamp Use        | ✅ N/A     |
| DoS Vulnerability    | ⚠️ Minor  |
| Gas Efficiency       | ⚠️ Minor  |

## 🧠 Recommendations

- ✅ Add inline comments explaining the safety of `.call{value:}`.
- ⚠️ Limit or paginate active transactions.
- ⚙️ Optimize gas in loops.
